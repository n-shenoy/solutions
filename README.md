1. To change your working directory in Linux to a external drive: https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/j3wgsf/how_do_i_change_directory_to_an_usb_flash_drive/ or https://www.scivision.dev/mount-usb-drives-windows-subsystem-for-linux/
2. If a python package doesn't install on Windows, try updating python and pip. Python can be updated by installing the latest version from the official website and then checking the “Add Python 3.9 to PATH” box in the installer. To update pip, type `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` in the `cmd`. If nothing works, try installing the package in Ubuntu, but you would have to run everything from the Linux environment.
